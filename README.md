ABOUT

For this device specifically, it is extremely complicated to unlock the bootloader, let alone root and flash custom ROMs. This toolkit aims to make it simple while giving users piece of mind from bricking. The toolkit performs many checks to ensure the process goes smoothly. This toolkit can do almost anything you want to your ZTE Axon 7 device including:

1) Install and test all necessary drivers
2) Backup/Restore apps+data through ADB 
3) Backup/Restore device partitions in TWRP
4) Unlock and lock your bootloader. The toolkit intelligently selects the fastboot package depending on your android version to prevent bricking. Your warranty also STAYS INTACT!
5) Flash TWRP with automatic dm-verity and forced encryption disabling!
6) Root with SuperSU
7) Restore to the stock ROM! This option works in Download mode, meaning that it will work even if your device is fully bricked!
8) Flash any and unlimited amount of zip files at once including Custom ROMs and kernels!
9) OTA updates! No need to visit the toolkit thread every time, just start the toolkit and automatically update!

The toolkit also downloads any dependencies that are needed such as TWRP Recovery images and SuperSU root zips with download verification. This means that dependencies can be updated seperately from the toolkit! (or downgraded if any issues arise!)

The toolkit supports ALL variants and ALL builds!

This toolkit is constantly updated with new features and bug fixes! Why are you still reading this? Check out the toolkit!
