# Axon7Toolkit
Toolkit for Axon7 (basically the same idea as the Nexus Root Toolkit but for the Axon 7)
This toolkit, when I'm finished developing it, will provide many of the functions of the Nexus Root Toolkit, for the Axon 7. 
The program itself will be a batch script compiled into an exe since I'm not advanced enough to make an actual program(lol).
I will try to make the program as one click as possible, but since its a batch script which is not as powerful as an actual program,
no guarantees.
Until I release the toolkit, there's really nothing to see here other than some dependency files and maybe the toolkit file 
for my testing purposes.

As of now the toolkit will be Windows only since its the OS I use. I probably won't ever make a Linux/Mac version as I have very
limited experience with SH scripts. You will probably still be able to run this program with a Windows emulator though.

Planned features:
1) Automatic file dependency downloads with Github being used for file hosting just like NRT
2) Automatic updates to dependency files and toolkit with Github being used for file hosting just like NRT
3) Automatic/Manual Driver Installation and Test
4) Backup apps+data
5) Restore apps+data
6) Bootloader Unlock with different methods for Marshmallow and Nougat builds
7) Flash TWRP and root
8) Bootloader Lock
9) Restore to stock with automatic package downloading as an option
10) (Maybe) ZIP Flashing (have to figure some things out)
11) ADB Sideload in TWRP (stock recovery's sideload is broken)
12) Ability to change various settings such as theme, build #, etc.

I'm working on this program with the very limited free time that I have since I love this phone and will definitely keep it for a 
long time. So this program may or may not be released depending on if I can ever finish it in my free time. 
I will also not be taking any requests until the toolkit is actually released(if it does get released) since I have enough to work 
on as you can see above.

When this toolkit will be released there will be a thread in the ZTE Axon 7 subforum on XDA-Developers here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/axon-7
Then you will be able to post any requests, bugs, questions, etc. and I will try to address them whenever I can (no guarantees since
I am a high school student and have a lot on my plate right now).

With all that said, stay tuned :)
